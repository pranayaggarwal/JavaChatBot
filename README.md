*  Maximum 3 connections accepted which is a pre-defined number

*  Enter ip address of server, port number on which connection is opened.
*  Enter your name in name input dialog.
*  Type your messages and enter **Send** button.
*  By default sent messages will be **broadcasted**
*  To send private messages, type - `@<receievername> <message>`
*  To send private messages to many users, type - `@<receievername1> <receivername2> ....<receivernameN>#<message>`
*  To see list of online users - Press **List of all Users** button
*  To quit chat room - type **QUIT**

This is what it looks like :)

### Client Connection Limit
Maximum number of chat clients is a hard-coded value (currently 3) in ChatServer. After that it doesn't create any connection queue, it simply keeps on rejecting all incoming requests till total number of connections are full.
